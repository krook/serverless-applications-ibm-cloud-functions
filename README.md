# Building serverless applications with Apache OpenWhisk

Apache OpenWhisk is a platform for a new class of "serverless" applications that typically run for very short times, on demand, in response to unpredictable events or groups of events. Serverless platforms bring bring the power of cloud computing (scale and cost) to a whole new range of applications that weren't a good fit for the HTTP-focused and daemon oriented Platform-as-a-Service, Containers-as-a-Service, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service models.

Applications that are a good fit for serverless architectures include those that processing data changes, analyzing IoT readings, implementing asynchronous chatbots, and running batch jobs. In addition to those new workloads, serverless platforms can also be a great fit for existing cloud workloads, such as HTTP REST APIs, mobile backends, and UI-driven applications thanks to their attractive scale-on-demand model and efficient cost model.

Note: While there are servers behind the scenes, the term serverless is popular because the developer's point of view has shifted away from the operational aspects of what starts, runs, and scales his or her code. That, and the application isn't always running at all.

This repository contains a curriculum for getting started building serverless applications on Apache OpenWhisk hosted as a services on IBM Bluemix. What sets OpenWhisk apart from other serverless implementations is that it's open source. That means it can be run in hybrid or edge scenarios, in addition to being consumed on the public cloud. That also means it can be extended for additional runtimes and event source adapters. And that also means that end users can see how data travels through the system and is stored.
